# GPXTR - Basecamp Route to Waypoint table

Notes:

- It uses GPX routes, not tracks.
- It produces output in Markdown, not HTML, but it's trivial for me to add that functionality if you like it.
- If you set the symbol type for the type of waypoint, it will include that in the Notes section and set gas markers as well.
- If you use departure times or layover times in BC, it respects those as well.
- Computes sunrise & sunset based upon start point of route.

Use:

1. Install latest version of python on your system, the executable will be called
   "python" or "python3" -- I'll assume python3/pip3
2. There is a python library installation program, pip3 (or pip) that we use for
   installing the dependencies for this program.
3. `pip3 install gpxpy`
4. `pip3 install astral`
5. running `python3 gpxtr.py` -- should give you the output:

    ```bash
    $ python3 ./gpxtr.py
    usage: gpxtr.py [-h] input
    gpxtr.py: error: the following arguments are required: input
    ```

    If not, one of the dependencies is missing.

6. Test it against sample input file, should generate the following output...

    ```text
    $ python3 ./gpxtr.py fort-ross.gpx
